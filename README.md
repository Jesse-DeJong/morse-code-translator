# morse-code-translator

Project due next Friday (May13th)
Project: Morse Code Translator
Create a webpage that allows users to input english and get a morse code output, and input morse code and get an english output

## MVP:
- Must support the alphabet, spaces, numbers
- Must give user feedback when they input unsupported characters
- Must be able to translate both ways
- Project must use javascript modules to seperate dom logic from vanilla js logic
- Can use react, or vanilla js.
- Functions you write must be unit tested (you won't be able to write unit tests for function that interact with the dom)
- Must look NICE, this will go on your portfolio

## Your project must have a README discussing the following:
- Screen shot of the app
- What your implement / thinking was
- How it works
- Why you chose to implement it this way
- What you would improve / focus on in the next iteration
